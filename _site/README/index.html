<h1>ist-vercel-demo</h1>
<p>This is a repo that has some examples of how to use vercel endpoints to pipe data in from a data endpoint.
Vercel is an interesting way of being able to ship web components in a way that come with a backend
built in to serve (or store) data needs using the same CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<h2>Will this scale though?</h2>
<p>Maybe? Honestly in how we're going to play in class, no. But as far as organic distribution of building blocks
this is a great way to play with web components, build a small back end, document an API, and that 3 step process
is in effect building a functioning micro frontend.</p>
<h2>How could it scale</h2>
<p>For our purposes here I'm saying &quot;scale&quot; as in human scale. Like mass adoption or usage throughout your company</p>
<ul>
<li>You'd have vercel or a similar app pipeline to test and build microservices for your elements</li>
<li>You'd have something building and shipping your web component defitions to a CDN</li>
<li>Storage would be in MongoDB / AWS / some place</li>
<li>You'd use the brick anywhere, the bricks would tap vercel based endpoints, which store / retreive data from AWS</li>
</ul>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>We need a new command to work with vercel locally</p>
<pre><code># the -g flag says to install it globally for your computer to use anywhere
npm i -g vercel
# or if you use yarn, global here is the same as npm call
yarn global add vercel
</code></pre>
